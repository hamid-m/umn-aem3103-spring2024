## Homework 3

**Due:** Thursday, March 28 at 11:59 PM.

An aerodynamics laboratory experiment is done where CL vs angle-of-attack data has been collected at discrete points.  After the experiment, you are asked: what angle-of-attack values are needed to achieve CL values of 0.55, 0.9, and 1.45?  After reviewing the data collected it becomes clear that those exact values were not measured.  You decide to use tools learned in AEM 3103 to answer the question.

Steps to get started:
1. Download the dataset `Rutan-VariEze-Aero-Params.zip` (See Jan. 31 on class schedule for link).
2. Download the starter script: [hw3_starter_script.m]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/hw3_starter_script.m %}){:target="_blank"}
3. Decide on a graphical display that:
  - (10 pts) Clearly communicates the answer sought.
  - (10 pts) Mentions the source of the underlying dataset.
  - (10 pts) Explains the models used and any assumptions.
  - (10 pts) Can be embedded into a presentation or publication and still easily read.
4. Design and build the graphic.  For this assignment all design implementation should be done in MATLAB.

Submission Formatting: 
  - Print/export your figure as a PDF
  - Submit via Gradescope

## Homework 2

**Due:** Sunday, March 24 at 11:59 PM.

1. Textbook problem 3.3(a)
2. Textbook problem 3.5
3. Textbook problem 3.7
4. Use the built-in MATLAB function `fzero()` to solve problems 3.5 and 3.7.
5. Textbook problem 3.24

Note: The book explicitly explains which problems should be solved using your own implementations and which should use built-in functions.  Adherence to this is expected.

Submission Formatting: 
- Submit your homework in Word or PDF format.
- Include both code and output.
- Avoid placing solutions to multiple problems on a single page to ensure clarity and ease of grading.
- Gradescope: Carefully assign pages to each problem.
- Make sure the pages are readable before submission.

## CAD Homework 

**Due:** Monday, Feb. 26 at 11:59 PM.

There are three problems for the assignment:
1. Part
2. Assembly
3. Drawing

Each are defined in the respective sections of the [Videos: Learning Solidworks](https://greenlakelabs.thinkific.com/courses/LearningSolidworks) series.  Look for the 3 "ASSIGNMENT" sections.

Submission Formatting: Submit a single PDF where each problem is on a separate page.  Assign the problems appropriately when submitting via Gradescope.

### Changelog
{: .no_toc}

- Feb. 15: Add details of assignment definition.
- Feb. 14: First outline.

## Homework 1

**Due:** Monday, Feb. 12 at 11:59 AM.

1. Textbook problem A.2
   - Using boolean operations to compare and output `True` or `False`.
2. Textbook problem A.5
3. Textbook problem A.8
4. Textbook problem A.10
5. Textbook problem A.24
6. Textbook problem 6.1
7. Textbook problem 6.7
   - [Hint]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/2024-02-08-hw01-prob6.7-hint.pdf %}){:target="_blank"}

Submission Formatting: Homework problems done in (possibly the same) MATLAB script can be "PUBLISHED" via the editor (look at the editor tabs).  Simply update the publishing settings from `html` output to `pdf`.  That will combine both the code and the output into a single file which can be submitted.
