Submission Formatting: Homework problems done in (possibly the same) MATLAB script can be "PUBLISHED" via the editor (look at the editor tabs).  Simply update the publishing settings from `html` output to `pdf`.  That will combine both the code and the output into a single file which can be submitted.
