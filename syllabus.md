## Objectives & Outcomes
This course is an introduction to using software and computational methods for solving aerospace engineering problems.  You will learn three sets of skills:
1. **Software:** *Good enough* software skills for starting to contribute as an aerospace engineer (software selection, data visualizations, project organization, code quality, version control).
2. **Numerical Methods:** Solving problems common in aerospace engineering (e.g. equation-solving, curve fitting, numerical differentiation and integration).  Generic methods as well as their implementation will be discussed. 
3. **CAD:** Using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software to draw parts, assemblies, and drawings

## Grade Components 
The course grades are formed around the following components: 

| Item    | Percentage | Target Assessment |
|--------:|:----:|:----|
| In-Lecture Assessments | 15% | Participation & in-class coding |
| CAD Homework  | 15% | Basic CAD |
| Other Homework  | 25% | Software and Numerical Methods | 
| Exams 1 & 2   | 20% | Software and Numerical Methods |
| Final Project | 25% | Integrating & applying skills to solve a problem |
| **TOTAL** | 100% |  | 

### In-Lecture Assessments

Short in-lecture assessments will be used in class to gauge understanding and track participation.  

*Grading: The lowest 4 scores will be dropped.  No make up.*

### Homework

Homework will be assigned throughout the course.  With the exception of CAD, many of the homework questions will come directly from the course textbook and are designed to strengthen your understanding of the theories behind the numerical methods we will use in class. 

*Grading: The lowest score will be dropped.*

### Exams
There will be two in-class exams. Instructions as to the usage of a note sheet and/or a computer during the exam will be provided in advance of each exam. 

*Grading: Exams cannot be made up without a valid, documented excuse (e.g. letter from doctor).*

### Final Project
The final project provides an opportunity to setup and solve an engineering problem using the skills covered in this class.

### Grades
Grades for specific components will be posted to Canvas.  Final grades will be posted to [http://www.aem.umn.edu/srs](http://www.aem.umn.edu/srs). 

Letter grades for the course will be assigned using the following scale:

| Letter Grade | Score     |
|-------------:|:----------|
| A, A-        | 90.0-100  |
| B+, B, B-    | 80.0-89.9 |
| C+, C, C-    | 70.0-79.9 |
| D+, D        | 60.0-69.9 |
| F            | below 60  |

This is only a rough scale. This scale may be adjusted depending on the performance of the class. Any adjustments
to the scale will only lower the cut-offs to achieve a specified grade; cut-offs will not be raised beyond those listed
here.

**Regrades:** If you have any questions or comments on the grading please contact the TA who graded your work. If you feel your work was incorrectly graded then submit your request for a regrade in writing (i.e. email) to the TA. You have one week to deal with grade disputes. The grade will be final if no request is made within one week. When disputing a grade, be aware that your work will be reexamined and as a result your grade can be reduced as well as increased.

**Extra Credit:** No extra credit opportunities to improve grades will be available either during or at the end of the semester.

## Scholastic Honesty
Cheating is completely unacceptable. University policies on scholastic conduct (see [Student Code of Conduct](https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/policies/Student_Conduct_Code.pdf){:target="_blank"}) will be strictly enforced.

## Course Outline
See the course [Schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule/) page.

## Additional Information

### Student Code of Conduct
The University seeks an environment that promotes academic achievement and integrity, that is protective of free inquiry, and that serves the educational mission of the University. To support this environment, the University seeks a community that is free from violence, threats, and intimidation; that is respectful of the rights, opportunities, and welfare of students, faculty, staff, and guests of the University; and that does not threaten the physical or mental health or safety of members of the University community.

As a student at the University, you are expected to adhere to Board of Regents Policy: [Student Conduct Code (pdf)](https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/2022-07/policy_student_conduct_code.pdf){:target="_blank"}. Note that the conduct code specifically addresses disruptive classroom conduct, which means "engaging in behavior that substantially or repeatedly interrupts either the instructor's ability to teach and/or a student’s ability to learn.” The classroom extends to any setting where a student is engaged in work toward academic credit or satisfaction of program-based requirements or related activities.

### Use of Personal Electronic Devices in the Classroom

Using personal electronic devices in the classroom setting can hinder instruction and learning, not only for the student using the device but also for other students in the class. To this end, the University establishes the right of each instructor to determine if and how personal electronic devices are allowed to be used in the classroom. For complete information, please review the Administrative Policy: [Teaching and Learning: Student Responsibilities](https://policy.umn.edu/education/studentresp){:target="_bank"}.

### Makeup Work for Legitimate Absences
Students will not be penalized for absence during the semester due to unavoidable or legitimate circumstances. Such circumstances include verified illness, participation in intercollegiate athletic events, subpoenas, jury duty, military service, bereavement, and religious observances. Such circumstances do not include voting in local, state, or national elections. For complete information, please see Administrative Policy: [Makeup Work for Legitimate Absences](https://policy.umn.edu/education/makeupwork){:target="_blank"}.

### Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Stalking and Relationship Violence
The University prohibits sexual misconduct, and encourages anyone experiencing sexual misconduct to access resources for personal support and reporting. If you want to speak confidentially with someone about an experience of sexual misconduct, please contact a confidential resource on your campus. If you want to report sexual misconduct, or have questions about the University’s policies and procedures related to sexual misconduct, please contact your campus [Title IX office or relevant policy contacts](https://eoaa.umn.edu/report-misconduct){:target="_blank"}.

Instructors are required to share information they learn about possible sexual misconduct with the campus Title IX office that addresses these concerns. This allows a Title IX staff member to reach out to those who have experienced sexual misconduct to provide information about personal support resources and options for investigation. You may talk to instructors about concerns related to sexual misconduct, and they will provide support and keep the information you share private to the extent possible given their University role.

For more information, please see Administrative Policy: [Sexual Harassment, Sexual Assault, Stalking and Relationship Violence](https://policy.umn.edu/hr/sexharassassault){:target="_blank"}.

### Equity, Diversity, Equal Opportunity, and Affirmative Action
The University provides equal access to and opportunity in its programs and facilities, without regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, gender, age, marital status, familial status, disability, public assistance status, membership or activity in a local commission created for the purpose of dealing with discrimination, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. For more information, please consult Board of Regents Policy: [Equity, Diversity, Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (pdf)](https://regents.umn.edu/sites/regents.umn.edu/files/2019-09/policy_equity_diversity_equal_opportunity_and_affirmative_action.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

### Disability Accommodations
My goal is to create a learning environment that is accessible and inclusive for all students. If you anticipate any barriers related to the design of the course (such as the format, materials, or structure), please contact me outside of class so we can explore potential options. If you have a disability and want to explore formal accommodations and/or further resources, please contact our campus Disability Resource Center (DRC).

### Mental Health and Stress Management
As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and may reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University services are available to assist you. You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via the [Student Mental Health Website](https://safe-campus.umn.edu/personal-wellbeing){:target="_blank"}. As an instructor/University community member, we care about the wellbeing of students. If health, safety, or mental health concerns are conveyed, we may consult with campus support offices to provide support and resources to a student.

### Academic Freedom and Responsibility
Academic freedom is a cornerstone of the University. Within the scope and content of the course as defined by the instructor, it includes the freedom to discuss relevant matters in the classroom. Along with this freedom comes responsibility. Students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for truth. Students are free to take reasoned exception to the views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled.
