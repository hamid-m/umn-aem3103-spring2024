## Exam 2 Topics (work-in progress)

The following is a suggested list of topics to review for Exam 2.

**ODE**
1. What is an ODE? (section 10.1)
1. Identify a linear ODE and a non-linear ODE. (section 10.1)
1. What is a numerical solution to an ODE?a (section 10.1)
1. Understand and use Euler's (Explicit) Method (also known as the forward Euler method) (section 10.2).
  - Analysis of truncation error won't be tested.
1. Understand modified Euler's method and why approximation is better (section 10.3).
1. Understand Runge-Kutta method and how it can be used.
  - Questions on a specific method (e.g. fourth-order) will supply any required constants.  Details on how to use them will not be supplied. (section 10.5)
1. Basic understanding on how to use `ode45` in MATLAB.


## Exam 1 Topics
The following is a suggested list of topics to review for Exam 1.

1. The full derivation and application of linear least-squares (section 6.2).
1. When possible, how to write a nonlinear equation in linear form (section 6.3).
1. Understand the differences between curve-fitting and interpolation (chapter 6).
1. Understand the problem with high-order polynomials (sections 6.4, 6.5).
1. Given the general equation, understand how to apply Lagrange and Newton's interpolating polynomials (section 6.5).
1. Understand what is a spline interpolation (section 6.6).
1. The purpose of a version control system and the basics of using Git (see schedule for resource).
1. The basics of MATLAB and how it is similar/different from Python (see schedule for resource).
