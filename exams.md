## Exam 2 Topics 

The following is a suggested list of topics to review for Exam 2.

**Numerical Eqn. Solving**
1. Be able to visually apply the following algorithms:
  - Bisection Method (e.g. Fig. 3-7)
  - Newton's Method (e.g. Fig. 3-10)
  - Secant Method (e.g. Fig. 3-15)
2. Connect the algorithm equations with the corresponding methods.
3. Multiple Roots: given an initial condition, determine which root will be found.
4. Understand these stop metrics:
  - Tolerance in f(x)
  - Tolerance in solution (x)
  - Estimated relative error
  - No. of iterations

**Visualizations**

Properties of good visualizations for communicating information clearly and efficiently.

**Numerical Differentiation**
1. Given a plot, be able to visually demonstrate the following algorithms (e.g. Fig. 8-5)
  - Forward Finite Difference 
  - Backward Finite Difference
  - Central Finite Difference
2. Awareness that methods can be extended to include more points.
3. Connect the algorithm equations with the corresponding methods.

**Numerical Integration**
1. Given a plot, be able to visually demonstrate the following algorithms( e.g. April 1 notes, pg 3)
  - Rectangle Method
  - Midpoint Method
  - Trapezoidal Method
2. Understand how Simpson's Methods are derived and how the equations (e.g. 1/3 or 3/8 methods) are applied.
3. Connect the algorithm equations with the corresponding methods.

**ODE**
1. What is an ODE? (section 10.1)
1. Identify a linear ODE and a non-linear ODE. (section 10.1)
1. What is a numerical solution to an ODE? (section 10.1)
1. Understand and use Euler's (Explicit) Method (also known as the forward Euler method) (section 10.2).
  - Analysis of truncation error won't be tested.
1. Understand modified Euler's method and why approximation is better (section 10.3).
1. Understand Runge-Kutta method and how it can be used.
  - Questions on a specific method (e.g. fourth-order) will supply any required constants.  Details on how to use them will not be supplied. (section 10.5)
