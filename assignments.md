**Due:** Sunday, March 24 at 11:59 PM.

1. Textbook problem 3.3(a)
2. Textbook problem 3.5
3. Textbook problem 3.7
4. Use the built-in MATLAB function `fzero()` to solve problems 3.5 and 3.7.
5. Textbook problem 3.24

Note: The book explicitly explains which problems should be solved using your own implementations and which should use built-in functions.  Adherence to this is expected.

Submission Formatting: 
- Submit your homework in Word or PDF format.
- Include both code and output.
- Avoid placing solutions to multiple problems on a single page to ensure clarity and ease of grading.
- Gradescope: Carefully assign pages to each problem.
- Make sure the pages are readable before submission.

1. Textbook problem A.2
   - Using boolean operations to compare and output `True` or `False`.
2. Textbook problem A.5
3. Textbook problem A.8
4. Textbook problem A.10
5. Textbook problem A.24

7. Textbook problem 6.7
   - [Hint]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /assets/2024-02-08-hw01-prob6.7-hint.pdf %}){:target="_blank"}

Submission Formatting: Homework problems done in (possibly the same) MATLAB script can be "PUBLISHED" via the editor (look at the editor tabs).  Simply update the publishing settings from `html` output to `pdf`.  That will combine both the code and the output into a single file which can be submitted.
